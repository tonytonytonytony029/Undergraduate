# e苗快疫通 — 疫苗接種與疫情快篩通報系統設計

This repository documents a complete system analysis and design project developed for an undergraduate **System Analysis and Design** course. The project proposes **e苗快疫通**, a conceptual system designed to improve the flow of vaccination scheduling and COVID testing information across users and institutions.

Although not implemented in code, the project followed standard software design practices, including stakeholder analysis, use case modeling, DFD, ER diagrams, and UI sketching.

## 📘 Project Summary

**e苗快疫通** is a conceptual healthcare communication system that integrates:
- Vaccine appointment scheduling
- COVID test result reporting
- Real-time epidemic monitoring

The system is targeted at both **general users** and **public health authorities**, providing a unified platform for epidemic-related communication and decision-making.

## 🧠 Key Design Elements

- **Requirement Specification**: Identified core user needs via structured use case analysis.
- **Data Flow Diagrams (DFD)**: Developed both Level-0 and Level-1 diagrams to visualize data movement and processing.
- **ER Model**: Modeled the database schema based on entity-relationship logic for future scalability.
- **Interface Design**: Proposed interface wireframes that align with expected user behavior patterns.
- **Risk & Deployment**: Evaluated possible technical and organizational risks and provided deployment suggestions for scaling in real scenarios.

## 👤 My Role & Contributions

Although this was a team project, I was responsible for **nearly the entire system design process**, including:
- Structuring the system flow and functional decomposition
- Creating the DFDs and ER diagrams
- Drafting UI wireframes and flow sketches
- Writing and compiling the main report
- Coordinating timeline and integration of team input

This hands-on experience helped me internalize the **importance of system thinking**, **clear documentation**, and **practical design alignment with user needs** — all skills directly applicable to software project planning and technical communication.

## 🎓 Educational Context

This project was developed as the final deliverable for the **System Analysis and Design** course. While no source code was implemented, the report followed **industry-relevant documentation practices**, simulating a real-world planning phase for system software.

## ✅ Final Notes

This repository showcases my ability to:
- Design a structured and scalable system based on user and organizational requirements
- Communicate design logic effectively through diagrams and documentation
- Drive project progress independently while integrating contributions from a team
